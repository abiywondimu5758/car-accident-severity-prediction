# Road Traffic Accident Analysis Project

Welcome to our project! This repo contains `DA_Project_Group3.ipynb`, a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes road traffic accident data from `rta_data.csv` and predicts accident severity using machine learning.

## What’s Inside
- **Setup:** Installs libraries like `pandas`, `sklearn`, and `tensorflow`.
- **Data Exploration:** Checks the dataset, handles missing values, and visualizes distributions.
- **Preprocessing:** Cleans data by removing rows with too many missing values.
- **Models:** Trains and evaluates K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes, and Neural Networks. KNN performs best with 0.64 accuracy.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/abiywondimu5758/car-accident-severity-prediction.git`.
2. Install Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or manually install `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `tensorflow`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`).
4. Place `rta_data.csv` in the same folder as the notebook.
5. Open `DA_Project_Group3.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells.

## Dataset
- Requires `rta_data.csv`. Add it to the repo directory or update the file path in the code.
